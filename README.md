# UrbanMapper 3D

Reliable extraction of building footprints based on satellite imagery is one of the first and most challenging steps in producing accurate 3D models and maps. While automated algorithms continue to improve, significant manual effort is still necessary to ensure geospatial accuracy and acceptable quality. Improved automation is required to enable more rapid response to major world events such as humanitarian and disaster response. 3D height data can help improve automated building footprint detection performance, and capabilities for providing this data on a global scale are now emerging. In this challenge, we ask solvers to use satellite imagery and newly available 3D height data products to improve upon the state of the art for automated building detection.

This project is seeking an algorithm that provides reliable, automatic extraction of building footprints based solely on orthorectified color satellite imagery and 3D height data.

Notes
* Some subfolders contain submission as a single zip file, others have a subfolder where files are unzipped. This had to be done this way because github doesn't support files larger than 100MB.
